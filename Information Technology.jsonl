Data Redundancy: By storing data in multiple locations or in a redundant format, the system can recover from data loss or corruption. This technique helps in maintaining the availability and consistency of data even in the event of hardware failure or other issues.\n3. Data Encryption and Access Control: Protecting data through encryption ensures that it cannot be read or altered by unauthorized parties. Access control mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the data, thus preventing unauthorized changes and maintaining the integrity of the data.\nEach of these techniques plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of data within IT services.
