However, this pursuit may conflict with other ethical considerations, such as the cultivation of virtues that may require restraint from immediate bodily pleasures, the potential harm to others that could result from excessive indulgence, and the philosophical argument that mental pleasures are superior to bodily ones.

The ethical considerations of political loyalty often involve balancing personal values with the collective good, and understanding when it is appropriate to prioritize one over the other.\nAn example to illustrate this could be a scenario where a government implements a policy that an individual finds morally objectionable.
