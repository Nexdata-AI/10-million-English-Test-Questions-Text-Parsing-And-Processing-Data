Increase", "B. Decrease", "C. Maintain", "D. Reverse"], "answer": "B", "parse": "Inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), function by binding to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, which typically leads to the opening of ion channels that allow negatively charged ions (like chloride) to enter the cell or positively charged ions (like potassium) to exit. This results in an increase in the cell's membrane potential's negativity or a decrease in its positivity, moving the potential further away from the threshold necessary to trigger an action potential. Therefore, the presence of inhibitory neurotransmitters makes it less likely for the post-synaptic neuron to fire an action potential.", "qtype": "Single choice question", "subject": "Medicine", "grade": "University", "has_img": false}

It halts the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair, stimulates the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, and initiates apoptosis in cells with irreparable DNA damage to prevent the development of cancer.", "parse": "The p53 protein is a critical component of the cellular response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses. It is known as the \"guardian of the genome\" due to its role in maintaining genomic stability. When functioning properly, p53 can halt the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair or trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) if the damage is irreparable. This prevents the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA, which could otherwise lead to the development of cancer. The key processes that p53 regulates include:\n1. Cell cycle arrest: p53 can activate genes that induce the cell cycle to pause, allowing time for DNA repair mechanisms to correct any damage.\n2. DNA repair: p53 helps to stimulate the expression of genes involved in the repair of DNA damage.\n3. Apoptosis: If the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired, p53 can initiate the process of apoptosis, leading to the death of the damaged cell and preventing the potential spread of mutations.\nUnderstanding these functions is essential for grasping the role of p53 as a tumor suppressor and its importance in cancer prevention.", "qtype": "Short answer question", "subject": "Medicine", "grade": "University", "has_img": false}

The challenges faced by drugs in crossing the BBB include the barrier's tight junctions and efflux transporters, which limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain, particularly for large or hydrophilic molecules, thus complicating the treatment of neurological disorders.", "parse": "The blood-brain barrier is a critical structure composed of specialized endothelial cells that line the capillaries in the brain. It serves as a selective barrier that restricts the passage of solutes and immune cells into the CNS. This selective permeability is crucial for maintaining the unique microenvironment of the CNS, which is essential for the proper functioning of neurons. The BBB prevents harmful substances and pathogens from entering the brain while allowing essential nutrients to pass through.\nHowever, this same barrier also poses a significant challenge for the treatment of neurological disorders. Many drugs, especially large or hydrophilic molecules, have difficulty crossing the BBB due to its tight junctions and efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein. This makes it challenging to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain in sufficient concentrations to treat conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors.\nTo answer this question, one must understand the role of the BBB in protecting the CNS and the implications of its selective permeability for drug delivery.
