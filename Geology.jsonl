This process is crucial in shaping landscapes as it redistributes materials from higher elevations to lower ones, leading to the formation of various landforms. There are several types of mass wasting processes, including:\n1. Falls: These occur when rock or soil detaches from a cliff or steep slope and falls freely under gravity. An example of a landform created by falls is a talus cone, which is a pile of debris accumulated at the base of a cliff.\n2. Slumps: Slumps are rotational movements of large masses of earth material along a curved failure plane. They can create features like slump blocks or landslides, which can alter the landscape significantly.\n3. Slides: Slides are planar movements along a single plane of failure. They can lead to the formation of landslides, which can be a major force in landscape evolution.\n4. Creep: This is a slow, continuous movement of soil and rock downslope. It contributes to the gradual lowering of slopes and the formation of features like terraces.\n5. Earthflows: These are rapid, fluid-like movements of earth material that can occur on slopes. They can create landforms such as debris flows or mudflows.\n6.
