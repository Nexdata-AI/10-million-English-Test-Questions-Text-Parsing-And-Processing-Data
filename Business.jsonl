Given a simplified scenario where a company must choose between two warehouse locations, one with a fixed cost of $500,000 and another with a fixed cost of $600,000, both with a variable cost of $2 per unit of distance traveled, the choice depends on the total cost. If the demand is uniformly distributed and the average distance from the first location to customers is 100 miles, while from the second location it's 150 miles, calculate the break-even point in units of distance traveled beyond which the second location becomes more cost-effective. Express the break-even point as an integer value of additional distance traveled beyond the initial 100 miles for the first location.", "option": null, "answer": "50", "parse": "To solve this problem, we need to compare the total costs of both locations at the break-even point. The total cost for the first location is the fixed cost plus the variable cost per unit of distance traveled multiplied by the total distance traveled. Similarly, for the second location, the total cost is the fixed cost plus the variable cost per unit of distance traveled multiplied by the total distance traveled.\nLet $ x $ be the additional distance traveled beyond the initial 100 miles for the first location at which the costs become equal. The total distance for the first location would then be $ 100 + x $, and the total distance for the second location would be $ 150 + x $. The break-even point is when the total costs for both locations are equal.\nThe equation for the break-even point is:\n$$ 500,000 + 2 \\times (100 + x) = 600,000 + 2 \\times (150 + x) $$\nSolving for $ x $ gives us the break-even point in terms of additional distance traveled for the first location.", "qtype": "Short answer question", "subject": "Business", "grade": "University", "has_img": false}
